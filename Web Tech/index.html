        <h1>What Are The Main Concerns With Technology?</h1>
        <p>
            There are many concerns when it comes to the use of computer technology, such as: 
            <ul style="color:royalblue">
                <li><b>Health Issues</li>
                <li>Environmental Impacts</li>
                <li>Ethics</li>
                <li>Cyber Crime</li>
                <li>Data Protection</li>
                <li>And Many More...</li></b>
            </ul></p>
            <p>
            This is a result of the constant evolution of technology throughout the years, leading to individuals misusing/abusing it to steal or harm others. 
            <br><br>In some cases, people believe that the way computer technology is being used is violating their privacy, as it can be used to track thier behaviour and interactions with others online. 
            <br><br>It can also put people's lives at risk, severely injure them or steal their personal data as a result of misuse or faulty programs.
            </p></div>

            <div class="reveal">
            <h1>How Are These Concerns Being Addressed?</h1>
            <p>
                The ways that these problems have been addressed is through the use of legislation. Many pieces of legislation have been implemented by governments around the world to try and prevent computers from being misused, allowing people to use them without having to worry about being maliciously attacked over the internet.
                <br><br>The laws that have been put in place to do so include:
                <ul style="color:royalblue">
                    <li><b>The Data Protection Act 1998</li>
                    <li>The Computer Misuse Act 1990</li>
                    <li>The Copyright Design and Patents Act 1988</li>
                    <li>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000</li>
                </ul>
            </p></div>
