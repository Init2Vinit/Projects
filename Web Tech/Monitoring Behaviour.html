                <h1>How Can Behaviour Be Monitored And Who Monitors It?</h1>
                <p>
                    Internet users' behaviour can be monitored in many different ways. <br><br>The primary form of behaviour monitoring is the use of cookies. <br>Cookies are messages web servers pass to your web browser when you visit internet sites. <br>When you request another page from your server, your browser sends the cookies back to the server. <br><br>The term 'cookie' is allusion to a <b>Unix</b> program called <b><i>Fortune Cookie</i></b> that produces a different message/fortune, each time it runs. <br>The most common form of cookie is used to track web activity. <br>The cookie itself acts as your identification card and every time you revisit the same site, your browser passes a cookie back to the server. <br>By doing this, the web server can gather information about which web pages the users visits the most and which pages are gathering the most repeat hits.

                <h1>Security Concerns When It Comes To Using Cookies?</h1>
                <p>If you accept cookies for advertising companies, they can develop detailed profiles of the people who select their ads across their customers' sites. <br><br>Also, the websites that create cookies can read them and allows them to keep track of your interactions on that website.</p>
                <p>In order to increase ad effectiveness (relevant user ads), ubiquitous tracking and ad-specificity are incorporated to achieve this. <br><br>However, a downside to this is that user privacy has to breached even further. A further blow to the user is that they don't collect the information with someone's consent.</p>
                <p>You can change what information on what the cookies collect from you so you don't have to worry about the cookies being used to track your every movement. Instead they will just gather the general information on what you do unless you specify otherwise or refuse to consent to collect cookies.

                    Some argue that this is unethical and contravenes basic human rights. <br><br>Others argue that this is essential to put people off committing crime.
