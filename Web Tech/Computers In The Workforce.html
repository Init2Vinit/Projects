              <p2 style="font-size:20px">The workforce is the people that are engaged in or available for work, either in a country or area or a particular firm/industry. Over the years, the workforce has seen significant changes and will continue to change at a fast rate due to a more interconnected world.</p2>

          <h1>How Are Computers Beneficial To The Workforce?</h1>
          <p>
              With the integration of computers into the workforce, they have brought many benefits to the people working. An example of how they are beneficial to the workforce include the ability to perform calculations and analyse data which reduces the time required for people performing calculations. 
              <br><br>Software can also be installed onto it which makes life easier for workers. 
              <br><br>The use of 3D modelling software in construction has allowed architects to design housing estates and buildings without having to physically draw it, reducing the time needed to design a building, highlighting how convenient computers are in the workforce.

          <h1>Concerns With Integrating Computers Into The Workforce</h1>
          <p>
            If an employee has been working with a firm for many years and computers get installed at said firm, then that employee's skill set will become redundant and they will have to learn new skills and programs in order to keep their job. This could cause additional stress for that worker and others in the workplace, which could decrease their productivity. 
            <br><br>Another problem that arises from the inclusion of computers in the workforce is the deterioration of communication skills as they will be more inclined to send emails to communicate, rather than face-to-face talking. This would make scenarios like meetings and presentation awkward and often stale as the workers won't know how to properly communicate their ideas to each other.

              <h3 style="color:green"><u><b>Advantages Of Computers In The Workforce</b></u></h3>
              <ul2>
                  <li><b><u><i>Makes Work Faster</b></u></i><br>One of the main advantages for using technology in the workplace is that it makes work faster. Computers combined with corresponding updated software help make an employee’s work easier. Also, thanks to computers, we can now store gigantic amounts of data files in databases, so we don’t need to keep hard copies in file cabinets. Now, if we need to find a file from a few years back, all we have to do is click a few folders and voila, you have a soft copy of your file.</li>
                  <br><li><b><u><i>Encourages Us To Be Updated</i></u></b><br>Being updated with new trends is always good for any employee, especially engineers. Once there is a new technology in the office such as a new software, a new computer, a new tool or equipment, we would want to tinker with it and learn how to operate this new tech. This gets our creative juices flowing.</li>
                  <br><li><b><u><i>Remote Connectivity</i></u></b><br>This is the ultimate advantage for me. Thanks to teleconference technology, the internet, and telecommunication apps like Skype, we are now able to connect with absolutely anyone in the world as long as we have internet. No matter where you are in the world, you are able to check on your work.</li>

              <h3 style="color:red"><u><b>Disadvantages Of Computers In The Workforce</b></u></h3>
              <ul2>
                  <li><b><u><i>Social Media Abuse</i></u></b><br>Social media is both a blessing and a curse. If it is used for the right purpose, the right frequency, and at the right time, it is a blessing. However, more often than not, it gets abused and becomes a curse. Because of its addictive topics, features, and ads, we get hooked to social media and sometimes when it is used inappropriately in the workplace, it can cost us our productivity.</li>
                  <br><li><b><u><i>High Maintenance Costs</i></u></b><br>Maintaining new technology can be expensive. Getting new software for our work computers can be very pricey. Maintenance for new equipment can be expensive as well, this is why many companies send some employees for maintenance training for new equipment so as to lessen the labour cost of hiring outsiders to maintain new equipment.</li>
                  <br><li><b><u><i>It Makes You Lazy</i></u></b><br>Since, technology makes things easier, it has the tendency to make us lazy. If we need to talk to a person in a different floor, all we have to do is call or send an email.</li>
              </ul2>

          <h1>Should Computers Be Removed Entirely From The Workforce?</h1>
          <p>Even though the use of computers in the workforce can cause stress and potentially erode at a worker's skill set, they bring about a larger number of benefits and utility to the workplace, making it easier for workers to complete their tasks in less time, allowing them to complete more tasks on their schedule. Taking this into consideration, we believe that computers shouldn't be removed from the workplace.
            <br><br>We think that finding the balance is key. Technology, just like everything else in this world, has its perks and its flaws. It’s a package deal that you can’t separate. That is why it’s important to find the balance between.
