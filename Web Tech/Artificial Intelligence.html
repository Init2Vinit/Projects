              <p2 style="font-size:20px">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines. Any device that perceives its environment and takes actions to maximise its chance of successfully achieving its goal is classified as AI. It was founded as an academic discipline in 1955 and has since evolved to the point where it can be found everywhere.<p2>

            <h1>What Are The Risks And Benefits Of AI?</h1>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a computer program to learn and think. Everything can be considered Artificial intelligence if it involves a program doing something that we would normally think would rely on the intelligence of a human. The advantages of Artificial intelligence applications are enormous and can revolutionize any professional sector. 
                <br><br>As every bright side has a darker version in it. Artificial Intelligence also has some disadvantages.
                <br><br>So let's address some advantages and disadvantages: 
            </p></div>

            <div class="reveal">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column3">
                  <h3 style="color:cyan"><u><b>Advantages Of Artificial Intelligence</b></u></h3>
                  <ul2>
                      <li><b><u><i>Reduction in Human Error</b></u></i><br>The phrase “human error” was born because humans make mistakes from time to time. Computers, however, do not make these mistakes if they are programmed properly. With Artificial intelligence, the decisions are taken from the previously gathered information applying a certain set of algorithms. So errors are reduced and the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility.</li>
                      <br><li><b><u><i>Takes risks instead of Humans</i></u></b><br>This is one of the biggest advantages of Artificial intelligence. We can overcome many risky limitations of humans by developing an AI Robot which in turn can do the risky things for us. Let it be going to mars, defuse a bomb, explore the deepest parts of oceans, mining for coal and oil, it can be used effectively in any kind of natural or man-made disasters.</li>
                      <br><li><b><u><i>Available 24x7</i></u></b><br>An Average human will work for 4–6 hours a day excluding the breaks. Humans are built in such a way to get some time out for refreshing themselves and get ready for a new day of work and they even have weekly offed to stay intact with their work-life and personal life. But using AI we can make machines work 24x7 without any breaks and they don’t even get bored, unlike humans.</li>
                      <br><li><b><u><i>Helping in Repetitive Jobs</i></u></b><br>In our day-to-day work, we will be performing many repetitive works like sending a thanking mail, verifying certain documents for errors and many more things. Using artificial intelligence we can productively automate these mundane tasks and can even remove “boring” tasks for humans and free them up to be increasingly creative.</li>
                      <br><li><b><u><i>Digital Assistance</i></u></b><br>Some of the highly advanced organizations use digital assistants to interact with users which saves the need for human resources. The digital assistants also used in many websites to provide things that users want. We can chat with them about what we are looking for. Some chatbots are designed in such a way that it’s become hard to determine that we’re chatting with a chatbot or a human being.</li>
                      <br><li><b><u><i>Faster Decisions</i></u></b><br>Using AI alongside other technologies we can make machines take decisions faster than a human and carry out actions quicker. While taking a decision human will analyse many factors both emotionally and practically but AI-powered machine works on what it is programmed and delivers the results in a faster way.</li>
                      <br><li><b><u><i>Daily Applications</i></u></b><br>Daily applications such as Apple’s <b>Siri</b>, Window’s <b>Cortana</b>, Google’s <b>Google Assistant</b> are frequently used in our daily routine whether it is for searching a location, taking a selfie, making a phone call, replying to a mail and many more.</li>
                      <br><li><b><u><i>New Inventions</i></u></b><br>AI is powering many inventions in almost every domain which will help humans solve the majority of complex problems.</li>
                  </ul2>
                </div>
                <div class="column4">
                  <h3 style="color:gold"><u><b>Disadvantages Of Artificial Intelligence</b></u></h3>
                  <ul2>
                      <li><b><u><i>High Costs of Creation</i></u></b><br>As AI is updating every day the hardware and software need to get updated with time to meet the latest requirements. Machines need repairing and maintenance which need plenty of costs. It’ s creation requires huge costs as they are very complex machines.</li>
                      <br><li><b><u><i> Making Humans Lazy</i></u></b><br>AI is making humans lazy with its applications automating the majority of the work. Humans tend to get addicted to these inventions which can cause a problem to future generations.</li>
                      <br><li><b><u><i>Unemployment</i></u></b><br>As AI is replacing the majority of the repetitive tasks and other works with robots, human interference is becoming less which will cause a major problem in the employment standards. Every organization is looking to replace the minimum qualified individuals with AI robots which can do similar work with more efficiency.</li>
                      <br><li><b><u><i>No Emotions</i></u></b><br>There is no doubt that machines are much better when it comes to working efficiently but they cannot replace the human connection that makes the team. Machines cannot develop a bond with humans which is an essential attribute when comes to Team Management.</li>
                      <br><li><b><u><i>Lacking Out of Box Thinking</i></u></b><br>Machines can perform only those tasks which they are designed or programmed to do, anything out of that they tend to crash or give irrelevant outputs which could be a major backdrop.</li>
                  </ul2>

              <h1>Should AI Be Used?</h1>
              <p>
                These are some advantages and disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence. Every new invention or breakthrough will have both, but we as humans need to take care of that and use the positive sides of the invention to create a better world. 
                <br><br>Artificial intelligence has massive potential advantages. The key for humans will ensure the <b>“rise of the robots”</b> doesn’t get out of hand. 
                <br><br>Some people also say that Artificial intelligence can destroy human civilization if it goes into the wrong hands. But still, none of the AI applications made at that scale that can destroy or enslave humanity.
                <br><br>However, we think that the key is to work together with AI to help us maximise welfare and minimise the losses.
