              <p2 style="font-size:20px">Automated decision-making is the process of making a decision without any human involvement. These decisions can based on factual data, and they can also be on digitally created profiles or inferred data. Examples of this include:</p2>
              <ul2 style ="font-size:20px">
                  <li>An online decision to award a loan.</li>
                  <li>An aptitude test used for recruitment which uses pre-programmed algorithms and objectives.</li>
              </ul2>

            <h1>What Are The Benefits Of Automated Decision-Making?</h1>
            <p>
                Automated decision making can be very useful for organisations and also benefit individuals in many sectors, including healthcare, education, financial services and marketing. They can lead to quicker and more consistent decisions, particularly in cases where a very large volume of data needs to be analysed and decisions made very quickly.
                <br><br>One way that automated decision-making could be used is for marking exam papers. An exam board could use an automated decision making system to mark a set of multiple choice questions. The system would be pre-programmed with the marks required to enter each grade boundary. The scores would then be automatically attributed to the candidates based on the marks that they got and the results would be available online.

            <h1>What Are The Risks With Automated Decision-Making?</h1>
            <p>
                There are many potential risks when it comes to the use of automated decision making. One of the risks is that the people might not understand how the process works or how it can affect them. This could mean that when a decision is made, they won't have access to the correct information and the decisions that the person take as a result of the decision could have very significant effect (e.g. an algorithm decides whether the loan is agreed and the decision is automatically delivered to the individual, without any meaningful human input). <br><br>Other risks include:
            </p>
            <ul style="color:royalblue">
                <li><b>Profiling is often invisible to individuals.</li>
                <li>People might not expect their personal information to be used in this way.</li>
                <li>People might not understand how the process works or how it can affect them.</li>
                <li>The decisions taken may lead to significant adverse effects for some people.</li></b>
            </ul></div>

            <div class="reveal">
            <p>
                Just because analysis of the data finds a correlation doesn’t mean that this is significant. As the process can only make an assumption about someone’s behaviour or characteristics, there will always be a margin of error and a balancing exercise is needed to weigh up the risks of using the results. The UK GDPR provisions are designed to address these risks.
                <br><br>According to Article 22 of the GDPR it states: "as a rule, there is a prohibition on fully automated individual decision-making, including profiling that has a legal or similarly significant effect;". This prevents people from being put into situations that could significantly affect them, addressing one of the main concerns that automated decision-making has.
