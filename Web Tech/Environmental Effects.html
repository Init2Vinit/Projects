              <p2 style="font-size:20px">There are many different ways that computer technology has an effect on the environment. Electrical strain, wasting energy and production are just some examples of the environmental problems that computers have. <br><br>Even though some of these can be reduced through the use of smart meters and many other ideas, due to the high number of computer technology in people's houses (TVs, laptops, PCs, washing machines etc.). If we also include the amount of computers in the industry, then it becomes more understandable as to why computers are problematic for the environment.<p2>

            Technology has had an impact on the environment that is both positive and negative. The use of computers affects the environment in different ways, such as energy consumption, technological waste, and the impact of remote working.

            <h1>E-waste</h1>
            <p>
                Technology is an ever-evolving field that has many innovations come and go every day. However, a very large consequence of this constant evolution is that older systems are disposed of as they become outdated. 
                <br><br>As a result of this, the older systems have to be disposed of somewhere and they have to be put into landfills, where they sit for tens of years, leaking out harmful chemicals which will end up in the ocean because they get taken towards the ocean due to the rain. Wildlife and sea life that live closest to the contaminated water source will be the severely affected by it, which would damage the ecosystem around the water source.

            <h1>Strain On Electricity</h1>
            <p>
                According to <a href="https://sciencing.com/laptops-affect-environment-23252.html" target="_blank"><b><u>Sciencing.com</u></b></a>, around 1.3 billion people worldwide own a personal computer, whether it be for work-related use or general use. Since there is a high number of computers around the world, the amount of electricity that is required to power them puts a massive strain on the electrical grid. This leads to power plants having to use up more of their resources (coal and gas) to be able to meet the level of energy needed to keep the computers running. 
                <br><br>The use of coal and gas to produce electricity creates pollution due to the more carbon being emitted from the power station.
                <br><br>These statstics are only for computers and we know that there are other capital and devices that require constant power which only aggravates the current situation.

            <h1>Production Of The Computer</h1>
            <p>
                The manufacturing on computer technology requires a amount of fossil fuels and the components that are used to make computers (CPUs, motherboards etc.) have minerals that are only found in different continents, meaning that they have to be imported, which creates pollution. 
                <br><br>A major problem with the extraction of raw materials that are required to make computers such as gold is that the tools utilised in the extraction have extremely high level of carbon emissions.
